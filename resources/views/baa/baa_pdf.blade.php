				<p class="list-level1"><span class="list-number">1.1</span> "Individually Identifiable Health Information" means information that is a subset of health information, including demographic information collected from an individual, and: (i) is created or received by a health care provider, health plan, employer, or health care clearinghouse; and (ii) relates to the past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition of an individual; the provision of health care to an individual; or the past, present, or future payment for the provision of health care to an individual; and (a) that identifies the individual, or (b) with respect to which there is a reasonable basis to believe the information can be used to identify the individual.</p>
				<p class="list-level1"><span class="list-number">1.2</span> "Protected Health Information" means Individually Identifiable Health Information that Business Associate receives from Company or from another business associate of Company of which Business Associate creates for Company which is transmitted or maintained in any form or medium. <br> "Protected Health Information" shall not include education records covered by the Family Educational Right and Privacy Act, as amended, 20 USC &sect; 1232g, or records described in 20 USC &sect; 1232g(a)(4)(B)(iv), or employment records held by Company in its role as employer.</p>
