					<p class="list-level2"><span class="list-number">d.	Force Majeure.</span> Neither Party shall be deemed in default hereunder, nor shall it hold the other Party responsible for, any cessation, interruption or delay in the performance of its obligations hereunder due to earthquake, flood, fire, storm, natural disaster, act of God, war, armed conflict, labor strike, lockout, or boycott, provided that the Party relying upon this section (i) shall have given the other Party prompt written notice thereof and, in any event, within five (5) days of discovery thereof and (ii) shall take all steps reasonably necessary under the circumstances to mitigate the effects of the force majeure event upon which such notice is based; provided further, that in the event a force majeure event described in this section extends for a period in excess of thirty (30) days in the aggregate, either Party may immediately terminate this Agreement.</p>
					<p class="list-level2"><span class="list-number">e.	Headings.</span> The section and paragraph headings appearing in this Agreement are inserted only as a matter of convenience and in no way define, govern, limit, modify or construe the scope or extent of the provisions of this Agreement to which they may relate. Such headings are not part of this Agreement and shall not be given any legal effect.</p>
					<p class="list-level2"><span class="list-number">f.	Amendments and Severability.</span> No amendment or modification of this Agreement, nor any waiver of any rights, will be effective unless assented to in writing by the party to be charged, and the waiver of any breach or default will not constitute a waiver of any other right hereunder or any subsequent breach or default. In the event that any provision of this Agreement should be found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained shall not, in any way, be affected or impaired thereby.</p>
					<p class="list-level2"><span class="list-number">g.	Assignment.</span> This Agreement is entered into to secure  the  services  of Provider  and  Participating Pharmacies.   Any assignment by Provider of this Agreement or any interest hereunder shall require the prior written consent of Compliance Reward.  As used in this Agreement, the term "assignment"  shall also include a change of control in Provider or any Participating  Pharmacy, by merger,  consolidation, transfer,  or the sale  of thirty-three  percent  (33%)  or  more  stock  or  other  ownership  interest  in  Provider  or  any Participating  Pharmacy.   Any attempt  by Provider  to assign this Agreement  or its interest  hereunder without complying with the terms of this Section shall be void and of no effect, and Compliance Reward, at its option, may elect to terminate  this Agreement  without  any further liability or obligation  to Provider. Compliance Reward may assign this Agreement in whole or in part to any purchaser of all or a substantial portion of the book of business  in respect  of which this Agreement  is executed,  or to any affiliate  of Compliance Reward, provided that the assignee agrees to assume Compliance Reward's obligations under this Agreement.</p>
					<p class="list-level2"><span class="list-number">h.	Independent Contractors.</span> The Parties to this Agreement are independent contractors. Neither Party is an agent, representative, or partner of the other Party. Neither Party shall have any right, power or authority to enter into any agreement for or on behalf of, or incur any obligation or liability of, or to otherwise bind, the other Party. This Agreement shall not be interpreted or construed to create an association, joint venture, partnership, franchise, sales, representative or employment relationship between the Parties or to impose any partnership obligation or liability upon either Party. Each Party shall bear its own costs and expenses in performing this Agreement.</p>
					<p class="list-level2"><span class="list-number">i.	Governing Law.</span> This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, without reference to conflicts of laws or choice of laws rules. All legal actions relating to this Agreement shall be brought in the state or federal courts located in the State of Texas.</p>
					<p class="list-level2"><span class="list-number">j.	Binding Arbitration.</span> The parties consent to have all disputes regarding this Agreement resolved by binding arbitration before the American Arbitration Association, Commercial Division.  The parties agree to conduct the arbitration in the county of Company’s principle office and that each party shall bear the costs of such arbitration.  The parties specifically waive any international treaties, or other international law, which may govern the court or location of resolution of any dispute between them.   This provision was a bargained for relinquishment of both parties’ rights to jurisdiction in their respective states or countries.  The parties waive the personal service of any process upon them and agree that service may be completed by overnight mail (using a commercially recognized service), or by U.S. Mail, with delivery receipt to the address stated in this Agreement.  The prevailing party in any arbitration shall be entitled to an award of attorney fees and costs for such arbitration.</p>
					<p class="list-level2"><span class="list-number">k.	Construction.</span> In the event that any provision of this Agreement conflicts with the law under which this Agreement is to be construed, or if any provision is held invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be deemed to be restated to reflect as nearly as possible the original intentions of the Parties, and the remainder of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. There shall be no presumption for or against either Party as a result of such Party being the principal drafter of this Agreement.</p>
					<p class="list-level2"><span class="list-number">l.	Records.</span> During the Term and for a period of 1 year(s) thereafter, the Parties will maintain books and records related to the customer transactions contemplated under this Agreement. Upon reasonable notice, the requested Party will provide such books and records to the requesting Party for review to ensure the requested Party's compliance with the terms of this Agreement.</p>
					<p class="list-level2"><span class="list-number">m.	Networks.</span>   Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in this Agreement,  Compliance Reward reserves the right,  at its discretion, to develop and market provider  networks  in which Provider  and/or any one or more of Participating  Pharmacies  may  not  be  selected  to participate,  unless  Provider  meets  the  terms  and conditions  of participation  in those provider networks  where applicable.   Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary herein, Provider understands  and agrees that in certain instances a client or employer group of Compliance Reward may request a specific network in which Provider  and/or any one or more of Participating Pharmacies  are not included  and that this is not in any event a breach  of this provision.   The parties agree that this  Agreement  applies  only to those Members  and to those    designated  by  Compliance Reward. This Agreement does not include participation as a preferred Provider in Compliance Reward Networks.</p>
